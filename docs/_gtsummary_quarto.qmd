Weâ€™re using some data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, a cohort of American young adults aged 14-22 at enrollment in 1979. They continue to be followed to this day, and there is a wealth of publicly available data online. Iâ€™ve downloaded the answers to a survey question about whether respondents wear glasses, a scale about their eyesight with glasses, their (NLSY-assigned ðŸ˜’) race/ethnicity, their sex (presumably at birth, but unclear), their familyâ€™s income in 1979, and their age at the birth of their first child.

1. There mean number of hours was `r mean_sleep_weekend`
2. There mean number of hours was `r mean(nlsy$sleep_wknd, na.rm = TRUE)`

```{r}
median_sleep_weekend <- median(nlsy$sleep_wknd, na.rm = TRUE)
median_sleep_weekend
```
3. The median numbers of hours was `r median_sleep_weekend` participants
4. The median numbers of hours was `r mean(nlsy$sleep_wknd, na.rm = TRUE)` participants"

The median and IQR are `r mean_hrs_sleep`
